With a tap of a button, the Theta S spherical camera can take up to 25 minutes of 360-degree videos. You can even live-stream your videos, if that's your thing.

只需轻轻一点，Theta S 球状摄像机便能拍摄长达25分钟的360度全景视频。如果你喜欢的话，你还能拿它做直播。

##MOCAheart, $149

**MOCAheart，149美元**

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/151123073316-coolest-gadgets-mocaheart-780x439.jpg)

After holding your finger to the MOCAheart reader for 25 seconds, the gadget claims it will deliver accurate heart rate, blood oxygen and blood flow information. The tiny 7 mm device syncs with your smartphone to help you track and monitor your heart's health over time.

据说，将你的手指放在MOCAheart的传感器上25秒钟，它便会为你带来精确的心率、血液含氧量以及血液流动信息。这个仅有7毫米的小小设备会和你的手机同步数据，一直监视你心脏的健康。

##Yono, $150

**Yono，150美元**

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/151123074505-coolest-gadgets-yono-780x439.jpg)

By wearing the Yono in your ear like an earbud headphone, Yono Labs claims that you can accurately track your fertility cycles and monitor your hormones. The Yono tracks your basal body temperature, notifying you of when you're at your most fertile period in your cycle. Tracking your temperature can be more accurate than tracking ovulation.

Yono Labs声称，只需把Yono戴在你的耳朵里，就像你平常戴耳机一样，你就可以精确地跟踪你的生育周期，还能监视你的荷尔蒙。Yono可以通过追踪你的最低体温（可查看<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_body_temperature>——译者注），在你经期的那些天提醒你。这比检测排卵期更为精确了。

##Roost smart battery, $35

**Roost智能电池，35美元**

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150624083559-roost-smart-smoke-alarm-battery-780x439.jpg)

The Roost, a $35 9-Volt Wi-Fi battery for your smoke alarm, will notify your smartphone when your smoke detector is going off, it will let you silence your smoke alarm from an app, and it will send low-battery alerts to your phone -- no more 3 a.m. wakeups.

Roost是一个9V的WIFI电池，它是为你的烟雾报警器设计的。如果你的烟雾报警器响了，它会通知你的手机，同时让你从一个APP将你的报警器静音，还会向你的手机发送低电量警告——你再也不用二半夜爬起来看报警器有没有电了。

##Microsoft Surface Book, $1,499

**微软Surface Book**

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/151006154955-microsoft-surface-book-side-view-780x439.jpg)

Microsoft's new [Surface Book](http://money.cnn.com/2015/10/21/technology/surface-book-review/) is a legitimately innovative laptop-tablet hybrid that could finally break the notebook PC out of its tired mold. When used as a standard laptop, Surface Book is crazy powerful. But unlike typical laptops, which put all the computing guts under the keyboard, most of the Surface Book's computing power happens behind its screen, making it a surprisingly lightweight and very powerful tablet.

微软的新款[Surface Book](http://money.cnn.com/2015/10/21/technology/surface-book-review/)是款颇具创新性的笔记本平板的混合产品，它会最终打破笔记本电脑旧有的形态。如果你把它当一个标准的笔记本来用，它是真心强大的。

##Trunkster, $325

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/151123082626-trunkster-780x439.png)

The Trunkster suitcase is like the Swiss army knife of luggage. It charges your cell phone. It weighs itself. It has a GPS tracker that connects to your smartphone in case you lose your luggage. And it has a zipper-free garage-door style opening.

##Polyera Wove band (no price yet)

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150814164859-polyera-bendable-screen-2-780x439.png)

The [Wove](http://money.cnn.com/2015/08/17/technology/flexible-wearables-polyera/) is a long, rectangular display that you can curve around your wrist like a snap bracelet. The band uses low-powered e-ink display technology used in Kindles. It's still a prototype, but developers can get their hands on one soon.

##T-Mobile CellSpot, $0

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/151113132319-coolest-gadgets-tmobile-cellspot-780x439.jpg)

T-Mobile customers with a "Simple Choice" plan can now receive a [free mini cell tower](http://money.cnn.com/2015/11/02/technology/tmobile-cell-tower/) for their home. The 8.5-inch square gadget blasts out T-Mobile's 4G-LTE network to an area of 3,000 square feet. That means in places where they may not have any "bars" of service, they'll now get a full, speedy connection.

##Batteroo Batteriser, $2.50

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150602070752-batteriser-780x439.jpg)

The Batteriser battery sleeve promises to extend the life of your batteries up to eight times longer by drawing out their remaining power -- which you were about to throw in the garbage. (When disposable AAs stop working, they actually still have about 80% of their power remaining.) The tiny, 0.1 millimeter-thick stainless steel Batteriser sleeve features an incredibly small circuit board, built to tap into the battery's remaining energy.

##Sharp LV-85001, $133,000

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150917100321-sharp-8k-tv-780x439.jpg)

The [world's first 8K TV](http://money.cnn.com/2015/09/17/technology/8k-tv/) has a resolution of 7680 x 4320 pixels. That means there are nearly 38 million pixels on the screen. 8K offers four times the resolution of 4K TVs (9 million pixels and a 4096 x 2160 resolution) and 16 times the resolution of a 1080p HDTV (2 million pixels with a 1920 x 1080 resolution). It's amazing to see. One caveat, though: There is hardly any 8K video to watch. (Heck, there is hardly any 4K programming available.)

##Microsoft HoloLens, $3,000

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/151123084244-coolest-gadgets-hololens-780x439.png)

Microsoft has developed goggles that offer an augmented -- or "mixed" -- reality experience. Unlike Facebook's Oculus Rift, which completely blocks out the outside world to fully immerse the wearer in another reality, HoloLens keeps one foot (and both eyes) firmly planted in the real world. The lenses of the goggles are transparent, your view of the space around you only selectively blocked by digital images that can mingle with real objects. It's currently only available for software developers.

##Motorola Droid Turbo 2, $624

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/151027133314-droid-turbo-2-780x439.jpg)

In a partnership with Verizon, Motorola introduced the Droid Turbo 2, the first phone with a shatterproof screen. The Droid Turbo 2's unbreakable screen is an engineering marvel. The screen is made of five distinct layers, each of which is designed to be shock absorbent.

##Sensel Morph touchpad, $250

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150824162903-sensel-morph-780x439.jpg)

The [Sensel Morph](http://money.cnn.com/2015/08/25/technology/sensel-touchpad/) is like a supersized extra-sensitive trackpad. You can draw and write on it, drag a cursor, or manipulate on-screen objects with your hand. But the coolest feature is that Morph will turn into any "object" you want: a keyboard, drawing tablet, piano, video game controller or drum pad, depending on how you use it.

##Intel Compute Stick, $100

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150107153000-intel-compute-stick-780x439.jpg)

The [Compute Stick](http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/07/technology/innovationnation/intel-compute-stick/) is the world's smallest Windows PC, a tiny thumb drive-sized device that converts any television or monitor into a functional computer. Similar to the Google Chromecast or Amazon Fire Stick, the Intel Compute Stick can be plugged into an HDMI port. The four-inch PC comes installed with Windows 10, 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage.

##BlackBerry Priv, $700

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/151104135216-blackberry-priv-780x439.jpg)

It's a [BlackBerry phone that runs Android](http://money.cnn.com/2015/11/06/investing/blackberry-priv-phone-android/). The previously unthinkable marriage has actually created a smartphone that is getting some very positive reviews. The Priv is expensive, but if you're constantly sending emails from your phone, the physical keyboard might just be worth it.

##Nikola Labs smartphone case, $99

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/151123075743-coolest-gadgets-nikola-labs-780x439.jpg)

Nikola Labs' [smartphone cases](http://money.cnn.com/2015/06/23/technology/wireless-charging/) harness and recycle the unused energy your phone creates by searching for cell towers and Wi-Fi routers. With normal use, the Nikola Labs cases don't actually charge up your phone -- they help extend your battery life by about a third. But that's probably more than enough to get you through your day.

##Roku 4, $130

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/151113135918-coolest-gadgets-roku-4-780x439.jpg)

The newest member of the Roku family is one of a very small handful of streaming media players to support 4K video. It does that with an insanely fast processor. It also has an optical digital audio and it even a handy remote control finder.

##Epson EcoTank printer, $379

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/151123073726-coolest-gadgets-epson-ecotank-780x439.jpg)

The Epson EcoTank printers are expensive, but they come with enough ink to print at least 4,000 black pages and 6,500 color pages. That's a stunning number of printouts that will probably take you more than a year to get through. And when you need to refill, the ink costs just $13 a package.

##Apple Watch, $349

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150715112936-apple-watch-780x439.jpg)

The [Apple Watch](http://money.cnn.com/2015/03/05/technology/apple-watch-fast-facts/) is the first smartwatch to truly capture consumers' attention. Sure, it's expensive and its abilities are somewhat limited, but it's among the most impressive smartwatches on the market. Watch innovations like Force Touch and the Taptic engine have even made their way into the new iPhone 6S.

##Thync, $199

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150629083029-thync-trial-780x439.jpg)

Thync, a wireless device that zaps your brain, promises to make you calmer or more energetic. All you have to do is stick the gadget to your head and let it beam you with low-levels of electric current until you get there (typically about five minutes). [Thync](http://money.cnn.com/2015/06/30/technology/thync-brain-zap/) was developed by a team of neuroscience and biomedical engineering experts.

##Google Chromecast, $35

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/151113132957-coolest-gadgets-google-chromecast-780x439.jpg)

Google's [new crop of streaming video players】（http://money.cnn.com/2015/09/29/technology/google-nexus-chromecast/ have better streaming quality than the old Chromecasts.

##Amazon Echo, $180

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/141106070320-amazon-echo-780x439.jpg)

The [Amazon Echo](http://money.cnn.com/2015/07/24/technology/amazon-echo-review/) is like a standalone Siri that sits on your coffee or kitchen table. It controls other things in your house and lets you search the Web (using Bing) for mundane information. And, because the device is linked to your Amazon account, you can tell the Echo to add things you've previously purchased to your shopping cart.

##Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, $750

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150428230438-samsung-galaxy-s6-780x439.jpg)

The curved screen on the new [Galaxy S6 Edge](http://money.cnn.com/2015/03/01/technology/samsung-galaxy-s6/) might not serve any practical purpose, but it sure looks cool. Throw in an aluminum body, an improved camera and Samsung Pay, and you've got the ingredients for one of the year's most popular smartphones.

##Apple TV, $150

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/151123083901-coolest-gadgets-apple-tv-780x439.jpg)

The new Apple TV lets you ask Siri to search through movies for you. It also includes a fancy touchpad remote control, beautiful interface and an all new app store. That's why Apple calls it the "future" of television.

##Moto X Pure Edition, $400

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150728130736-moto-x-pure-edition-780x439.png)

The [Moto X Pure Edition](http://money.cnn.com/2015/09/02/technology/moto-x-pure-edition/) is everything a great smartphone should be: It's thin, beautiful, fast, has a battery that will get you through the day, an awesome 5.7-inch display, a great camera and a super-fast turbo-charging battery. But the best part: it costs just $400 unlocked.

##Tag Heuer Connected, $1,500

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/151123085018-coolest-gadgets-tag-heuer-780x439.jpg)

Most smartwatches are ugly. But [Tag Heuer's new smartwatch](http://money.cnn.com/2015/03/20/technology/google-tag-heuer-smartwatch/) combines the latest wearable technology with the design aesthetics that Swiss watchmakers are famous for. You'll just need $1,500 to get one.

##Apple MacBook, $1,300

Apple's new [MacBook](http://money.cnn.com/2015/03/10/technology/apple-12-inch-macbook/) is its thinnest and lightest laptop to date. To achieve this feat, Apple engineers streamlined many features traditionally associated with portable computers, giving the new computer just two ports. It has no fan, it's 24% thinner than a MacBook Air, and it weighs just two pounds.

##Jamstik+ SmartGuitar, $300

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/151123075026-coolest-gadgets-jamstik-780x439.jpg)

Are you good at Guitar Hero but have no clue how to play the actual guitar? The Jamstik+ makes learning guitar just as easy as a video game. An app with interactive guitar lessons connects to the Jamstick via Bluetooth. Sorry Windows and Android customers: it's iOS-only.

##Google OnHub router, $199

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150818131212-google-router-onhub-780x439.jpg)

Wi-Fi routers work best when they're out in the open -- but they're ugly, so we usually hide them behind plants or walls. [Google's new OnHub router](http://money.cnn.com/2015/08/31/technology/onhub-google-router/) is pretty enough to come out of hiding, and it has a killer app for setting up your network and diagnosing problems.

##Apple iPhone 6S, $650

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150910083003-iphone-evolution-6s-780x439.jpg)

The iPhone 6S' coolest new feature is 3D touch, which measures how forcefully you press down on the screen. It works kind of a like a right click: Apple lets you push down hard to preview links, jump to frequent contacts or watch a "live photo." It's a nice new feature for those who wait for the "S" version of iPhones.

##Dell Chromebook 13, $399

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150813063417-dell-chromebook-780x439.jpg)

By releasing a new Chromebook that's super-powered for the workplace, Google is putting Microsoft firmly in its crosshairs.

##Synaptics SmartBar (no price)

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/151123080608-coolest-gadgets-smartbar-780x439.jpg)
