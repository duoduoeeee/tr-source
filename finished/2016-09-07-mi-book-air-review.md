I just received the all new Xiaomi Mi Book Air laptop at my home and simply cannot wait to show this little laptop off. Check the Mi Book Air hands on and first impressions below.

我刚刚才在我家收到了这台全新的小米笔记本，等不及要给大家炫耀一下。以下就是我的上手体验和对它的第一印象。

Xiaomi launched their Mi Book Air, their first laptop, only a few weeks ago and just last week they released the smaller of the two laptops in silver in a limited run. Luckily for us shop.gizchina.com have their ear to the ground when it comes to the latest tech and they have been quick to snatch the device up and get one to me.

仅仅几周之前，小米发布了小米 Air 笔记本，而就在上周，他们很快地又发布了银色的（12.5寸）版本，这是两款笔记本中较小的一款。幸运的是我们 shop.gizchina.com 及时跟进了他们最新的科技，他们很快拿到了设备，给我弄到了一台。

The Mi Book Air I have is the 12.5-inch version with integrated graphics which costs 3499 Yuan in China. I have this version simply because it’s the only one available, but the compact laptop will make a great travel device for work.

我拿到的小米笔记本 Air 是12.5英寸的版本，自带集显，在中国卖 3499 块。我之所以拿到这款仅仅是因为我们只拿到了这一台电脑，但是这款紧凑的笔记本带着出差当工作机很棒。

The 12.5-inch Mi Book Air offers a larger display over the smallest Apple Macbook Air, but physically they are very similar in size. This is due to the much narrower bezels around the 12.5-inch Xiaomi panel.

这款 12.5 英寸的小米 Air 屏幕比最小款的 MacBook Air 要大些，但是它们主体的尺寸十分相近，这是因为小米 12.5 英寸的面板周围的边框窄好多。

Build is also different to the Macbook Air, rather than being CNC machined from a single piece of alloy, but rather made in two pieces. This doesn’t detract from the looks of the Mi Book Air, but it does give a less sturdy, lower quality feel.

制造工艺也与 MacBook Air 有所不同。苹果的 MacBook Air 是由一块铝合金在 CNC 车床上加工的，而 Mi Book Air 则由两块铝合金加工而成。这一点不会使得小米笔记本的外观有所打折，但是的确给人一种

The differences continue in the ports on offer with the Xioami getting a full size HDMI plug, USB type C, standard USB and 3.5mm headphone jack. The lack of SD port is a real shame for me, but as most modern cameras offer a WIFI connection I’m sure it’s something we can learn to live without.

Opened up thook Air has a near full size keyboard with bright backlighting. There is only an option to turn the backlight on or offer, rather than varying the degree of brightness, but it’s a lovely feature to have.

On the hardware front, the Xiaomi Mi Book Air has AKG audio and a very high quality set of speakers on the underside. Compared to my wife’s Macbook Air (which is an older model) the Xiaomi has way better audio. The 1920 x 1080 display is also much brighter and offers a crisper visual experience.

On the performance side of things the 12.5-inch Xiaomi Mi Book Air has 4GB RAM, 128GB memory, and Intel Core M3 chipset with integrated GPU. This isn’t going to be a gamers laptop, but for someone like me who wants to blog, browse the web and edit photos, the Mi Book Air offers plenty of grunt.

As already mentioned, shop.gizchina.com is the store to get the Mi Book Air from, but remember at the time of writing only this smaller (lower spec) version is available.

I’ll be using the Xiaomi Mi Book Air from today onwards, which means I’ll not only be using a new laptop but also learning to use Windows 10… but keep posted for updates over the next few weeks.
