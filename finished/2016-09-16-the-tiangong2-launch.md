_Hong Kong (CNN)_ China is set to launch a second space lab into orbit Thursday, a crucial step in Beijing's ambition to have a permanent space presence.

中国业已准备好于周四向（地球）轨道发射第二座空间实验室，这是中国向在太空中具备永久性存在这一目标所走出的关键一步。

A Long March 2F rocket is expected to blast off at 10.04 p.m. local time (10:04 a.m. ET) from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert carrying the lab, known as Tiangong 2 or "Heavenly Palace," state media reported.

中国媒体报道称，搭载有“天宫2号”的长征 2F 火箭将在当地时间的晚间10：04（美国东部时间同日上午10：04）于戈壁滩中的酒泉卫星发射中心发射。“天宫”在汉语里的意思是“天上的宫殿”。


The Long March 2F carrier rocket is scheduled to blast off on September 15, 2016.

The new lab is able to host astronauts for much longer than its predecessor, the Tiangong 1, which was launched in 2011. It has two cabins -- one for astronauts and experiments, the other for equipment.

If Thursday's launch is successful, next month the [Shenzhou-11 spacecraft holding a two-man crew is expected to launch ](http://cnn.com/2016/02/28/asia/china-space-lab/)in mid to late October -- China's first manned mission since 2013.

It will dock with the space lab and the two astronauts will spend 30 days there carrying out experiments -- making it China's longest mission yet.

The Tiangong-2, and its predecessor Tiangong-1, are prototypes for China's ultimate goal -- a permanent 20-ton space station, which is expected to launch after 2020.

"Tiangong is a precursor testbed of capabilities, building toward the large space station has always been the culminating goal of the Shenzhou program," said Joan Johnson-Freese, a professor at the Naval War College specializing in space programs and space security.
